   abstract = {Cancer remains the second leading cause of death worldwide and newly diagnosed cases have increased at an alarming rate. One in every four people has a lifetime risk of being afflicted with cancer. Early diagnosis, which is essential in reducing morbidity and mortality, requires the development of highly sensitive and specific techniques to identify and monitor molecular changes for cancer-specific genetic and epigenetic markers. Among these, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), DNA microarray and NanoString technologies are notable. Recent advances in the development of efficient and cost-effective next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled whole genome, exome and transcriptome analysis. This review focuses on the features and applications of important molecular techniques to detect various genetic mutations thus enabling improved diagnosis, treatment and outcome.},

   abstract = {We report an advanced web server, the plant-specific small noncoding RNA interference tool pssRNAit, which can be used to design a pool of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for highly effective, specific, and nontoxic gene silencing in plants. In developing this tool, we integrated the transcript dataset of plants, several rules governing gene silencing, and a series of computational models of the biological mechanism of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. The designed pool of siRNAs can be used to construct a long double-strand RNA and expressed through virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) or synthetic transacting siRNA vectors for gene silencing. We demonstrated the performance of pssRNAit by designing and expressing the VIGS constructs to silence Phytoene desaturase (PDS) or a ribosomal protein-encoding gene, RPL10 (QM), in Nicotiana benthamiana. We analyzed the expression levels of predicted intended-target and off-target genes using reverse transcription quantitative PCR. We further conducted an RNA-sequencing-based transcriptome analysis to assess genome-wide off-target gene silencing triggered by the fragments that were designed by pssRNAit, targeting different homologous regions of the PDS gene. Our analyses confirmed the high accuracy of siRNA constructs designed using pssRNAit. The pssRNAit server, freely available at https://plantgrn.noble.org/pssRNAit/, supports the design of highly effective and specific RNAi, VIGS, or synthetic transacting siRNA constructs for high-throughput functional genomics and trait improvement in >160 plant species.},

   abstract = {<sec>BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 causes ongoing pandemic coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), infects the cells of the lower respiratory tract that leads to a cytokine storm in a significant number of patients resulting in severe pneumonia, shortness of breathing, respiratory and organ failure. Extensive studies suggested the role of Vitamin D in suppressing cytokine storm in COVID-19 and reducing viral infection; however, the precise molecular mechanism is not clearly known. In this work, bioinformatics and systems biology approaches were used to understand SARS-CoV-2 induced cytokine pathways and the potential mechanism of Vitamin D in suppressing cytokine storm and enhancing antiviral response.</sec><sec>ResultsThis study used transcriptome data and identified 108 differentially expressed host genes (DEHGs) in SARS-CoV-2 infected normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells compared to control. Then, the DEHGs was integrated with the human protein-protein interaction data to generate a SARS-CoV-2 induced host gene regulatory network (SiHgrn). Analysis of SiHgrn identified a sub-network “Cluster 1” with the highest MCODE score, 31 up-regulated genes, and predominantly associated immune and inflammatory response. Interestingly, the iRegulone tool identified that “Cluster 1” is under the regulation of transcription factors STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, POU2F2, and NFkB1, collectively referred to as “host response signature network”. Functional enrichment analysis with NDEx revealed that the “host response signature network” is predominantly associated with critical pathways, including “cytokines and inflammatory response”, “non-genomic action of Vitamin D”, “the human immune response to tuberculosis”, and “lung fibrosis”. Finally, in-depth analysis and literature mining revealed that Vitamin D binds with its receptor and could work through two different pathways: (i) it inhibits the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines through blocking the TNF induced NFkB1 signaling pathway; and (ii) it initiates the expression of interferon-stimulating genes (ISGs) for antiviral defense program through activating the IFN-α induced Jak-STAT signaling pathway.</sec><sec>ConclusionThis comprehensive study identified the pathways associated with cytokine storm in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The proposed underlying mechanism of Vitamin D could be promising in suppressing the cytokine storm and inducing a robust antiviral response in severe COVID-19 patients. The finding in this study urgently needs further experimental validations for the suitability of Vitamin D in combination with IFN-α to control severe COVID-19.</sec>},

   pages = {105},
   abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are produced by the sequential processing of a long hairpin RNA transcript by Drosha and Dicer, an RNase III enzymes, and form transitory small RNA duplexes. One strand of the duplex, which incorporates into RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and silences the gene expression is called guide strand, or miRNA; while the other strand of duplex is degraded and called the passenger strand, or miRNA*. Predicting the guide strand of miRNA is important for better understanding the RNA interference pathways.|This paper describes support vector machine (SVM) models developed for predicting the guide strands of miRNAs. All models were trained and tested on a dataset consisting of 329 miRNA and 329 miRNA* pairs using five fold cross validation technique. Firstly, models were developed using mono-, di-, and tri-nucleotide composition of miRNA strands and achieved the highest accuracies of 0.588, 0.638 and 0.596 respectively. Secondly, models were developed using split nucleotide composition and achieved maximum accuracies of 0.553, 0.641 and 0.602 for mono-, di-, and tri-nucleotide respectively. Thirdly, models were developed using binary pattern and achieved the highest accuracy of 0.708. Furthermore, when integrating the secondary structure features with binary pattern, an accuracy of 0.719 was seen. Finally, hybrid models were developed by combining various features and achieved maximum accuracy of 0.799 with sensitivity 0.781 and specificity 0.818. Moreover, the performance of this model was tested on an independent dataset that achieved an accuracy of 0.80. In addition, we also compared the performance of our method with various siRNA-designing methods on miRNA and siRNA datasets.|In this study, first time a method has been developed to predict guide miRNA strands, of miRNA duplex. This study demonstrates that guide and passenger strand of miRNA precursors can be distinguished using their nucleotide sequence and secondary structure. This method will be useful in understanding microRNA processing and can be implemented in RNA silencing technology to improve the biological and clinical research. A web server has been developed based on SVM models described in this study (http://crdd.osdd.net:8081/RISCbinder/).},

Accumulating evidence indicates a connection between these two diseases at the molecular level. Much of what we currently know about T2D and AD is derived from in vivo and in vitro studies. However, further research and characterization of molecules is necessary to establish a strong connection between T2D and AD. In silico studies play a major role in finding non-evident patterns of gene expression and gene network connectivity. In this review, we give a brief introduction to T2D and AD and then describe the risk factors and molecules that are commonly associated with these diseases. Finally, we discuss the future directions and applications of bioinformatics that can provide greater insight into the relationship between these two diseases. Analysis and integration of high-throughput data on genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics from normal and disease tissues would be very useful to improve our understanding of the mechanism behind disease initiation and the connection between these two diseases. We encourage researchers to use bioinformatics approaches to identify genes and their regulatory pathways that are commonly affected in T2D and AD, as these genes and pathways could be potential biomarkers and targets for disease treatment.},

   abstract = {Eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA) contains not only protein-coding regions but also a plethora of functional cis-elements that influence or coordinate a number of regulatory aspects of gene expression, such as mRNA stability, splicing forms, and translation rates. Understanding the rules that apply to each of these element types (e.g., whether the element is defined by primary or higher-order structure) allows for the discovery of novel mechanisms of gene expression as well as the design of transcripts with controlled expression. Bioinformatics plays a major role in creating databases and finding non-evident patterns governing each type of eukaryotic functional element. Much of what we currently know about mRNA regulatory elements in eukaryotes is derived from microorganism and animal systems, with the particularities of plant systems lagging behind. In this review, we provide a general introduction to the most well-known eukaryotic mRNA regulatory motifs (splicing regulatory elements, internal ribosome entry sites, iron-responsive elements, AU-rich elements, zipcodes, and polyadenylation signals) and describe available bioinformatics resources (databases and analysis tools) to analyze eukaryotic transcripts in search of functional elements, focusing on recent trends in bioinformatics methods and tool development. We also discuss future directions in the development of better computational tools based upon current knowledge of these functional elements. Improved computational tools would advance our understanding of the processes underlying gene regulations. We encourage plant bioinformaticians to turn their attention to this subject to help identify novel mechanisms of gene expression regulation using RNA motifs that have potentially evolved or diverged in plant species.},

   abstract = {RNA interference (RNAi) is one of the most popular and effective molecular technologies for knocking down the expression of an individual gene of interest in living organisms. Yet the technology still faces the major issue of nonspecific gene silencing, which can compromise gene functional characterization and the interpretation of phenotypes associated with individual gene knockdown. Designing an effective and target-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) for induction of RNAi is therefore the major challenge in RNAi-based gene silencing. A 'good' siRNA molecule must possess three key features: (a) the ability to specifically silence an individual gene of interest, (b) little or no effect on the expressions of unintended siRNA gene targets (off-target genes), and (c) no cell toxicity. Although several siRNA design and analysis algorithms have been developed, only a few of them are specifically focused on gene silencing in plants. Furthermore, current algorithms lack a comprehensive consideration of siRNA specificity, efficacy, and nontoxicity in siRNA design, mainly due to lack of integration of all known rules that govern different steps in the RNAi pathway. In this review, we first describe popular RNAi methods that have been used for gene silencing in plants and their serious limitations regarding gene-silencing potency and specificity. We then present novel, rationale-based strategies in combination with computational and experimental approaches to induce potent, specific, and nontoxic gene silencing in plants.},

The structural and sequence features on pre-miRNA which can facilitate position and efficiency of cleavage are not well known. A precise cleavage by Dicer is crucial because an inaccurate processing can produce miRNA with different seed regions which can alter the repertoire of target genes.|In this study, a novel method has been developed to predict Dicer cleavage sites on pre-miRNAs using Support Vector Machine. We used the dataset of experimentally validated human miRNA hairpins from miRBase, and extracted fourteen nucleotides around Dicer cleavage sites. We developed number of models using various types of features and achieved maximum accuracy of 66% using binary profile of nucleotide sequence taken from 5p arm of hairpin. The prediction performance of Dicer cleavage site improved significantly from 66% to 86% when we integrated secondary structure information. This indicates that secondary structure plays an important role in the selection of cleavage site. All models were trained and tested on 555 experimentally validated cleavage sites and evaluated using 5-fold cross validation technique. In addition, the performance was also evaluated on an independent testing dataset that achieved an accuracy of ~82%.|Based on this study, we developed a webserver PHDcleav (http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/phdcleav/) to predict Dicer cleavage sites in pre-miRNA. This tool can be used to investigate functional consequences of genetic variations/SNPs in miRNA on Dicer cleavage site, and gene silencing. Moreover, it would also be useful in the discovery of miRNAs in human genome and design of Dicer specific pre-miRNAs for potent gene silencing.},

However these methods have been developed for predicting efficacy of fully complementary siRNA against a gene. Best of author's knowledge no method has been developed for predicting efficacy of mismatch siRNA against a gene. In this study, a systematic attempt has been made to identify highly effective complementary as well as mismatch siRNAs for silencing a gene.Support vector machine (SVM) based models have been developed for predicting efficacy of siRNAs using composition, binary and hybrid pattern siRNAs. We achieved maximum correlation 0.67 between predicted and actual efficacy of siRNAs using hybrid model. All models were trained and tested on a dataset of 2182 siRNAs and performance was evaluated using five-fold cross validation techniques. The performance of our method desiRm is comparable to other well-known methods. In this study, first time attempt has been made to design mutant siRNAs (mismatch siRNAs). In this approach we mutated a given siRNA on all possible sites/positions with all possible nucleotides. Efficacy of each mutated siRNA is predicted using our method desiRm. It is well known from literature that mismatches between siRNA and target affects the silencing efficacy. Thus we have incorporated the rules derived from base mismatches experimental data to find out over all efficacy of mutated or mismatch siRNAs. Finally we developed a webserver, desiRm (http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/desirm/) for designing highly effective siRNA for silencing a gene.

   abstract = {Along with the canonical miRNA, distinct miRNA-like sequences called sibling miRNAs (sib-miRs) are generated from the same pre-miRNA. Among them, isomeric sequences featuring slight variations at the terminals, relative to the canonical miRNA, constitute a pool of isomeric sibling miRNAs (isomiRs). Despite the high prevalence of isomiRs in eukaryotes, their features and relevance remain elusive. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of mature precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) sequences from Arabidopsis to understand their features and regulatory targets. The influence of isomiR terminal heterogeneity in target binding was examined comprehensively. Our comprehensive analyses suggested a novel computational strategy that utilizes miRNA and its isomiRs to enhance the accuracy of their regulatory target prediction in Arabidopsis. A few targets are shared by several members of isomiRs; however, this phenomenon was not typical. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that commonly targeted mRNAs were enriched for certain GO terms. Moreover, comparison of these commonly targeted genes with validated targets from published data demonstrated that the validated targets are bound by most isomiRs and not only the canonical miRNA. Furthermore, the biological role of isomiRs in target cleavage was supported by degradome data. Incorporating this finding, we predicted potential target genes of several miRNAs and confirmed them by experimental assays. This study proposes a novel strategy to improve the accuracy of predicting miRNA targets through combined use of miRNA with its isomiRs.},

   abstract = {The emergence of a new coronavirus (CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for severe respiratory disease in humans termed coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), became a new global threat for health and the economy. The SARS-CoV-2 genome is about a 29,800-nucleotide-long plus-strand RNA that can form functionally important secondary and higher-order structures called cis-acting RNA elements. These elements can interact with viral proteins, host proteins, or other RNAs and be involved in regulating translation and replication processes of the viral genome and encapsidation of the virus. However, the cis-acting RNA elements and their biological roles in SARS-CoV-2 as well as their comparative analysis in the closely related viral genome have not been well explored, which is very important to understand the molecular mechanism of viral infection and pathogenies. In this study, we used a bioinformatics approach to identify the cis-acting RNA elements in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Initially, we aligned the full genomic sequence of six different CoVs, and a phylogenetic analysis was performed to understand their evolutionary relationship. Next, we predicted the cis-acting RNA elements in the SARS-CoV-2 genome using the structRNAfinder tool. Then, we annotated the location of these cis-acting RNA elements in different genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2. After that, we analyzed the sequence conservation patterns of each cis-acting RNA element among the six CoVs. Finally, the presence of cis-acting RNA elements across different CoV genomes and their comparative analysis was performed. Our study identified 12 important cis-acting RNA elements in the SARS-CoV-2 genome; among them, Corona_FSE, Corona_pk3, and s2m are highly conserved across most of the studied CoVs, and Thr_leader, MAT2A_D, and MS2 are uniquely present in SARS-CoV-2. These RNA structure elements can be involved in viral translation, replication, and encapsidation and, therefore, can be potential targets for better treatment of COVID-19. It is imperative to further characterize these cis-acting RNA elements experimentally for a better mechanistic understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and therapeutic intervention.},

   abstract = {The BLM helicase protein plays a vital role in DNA replication and the maintenance of genomic integrity. Variation in the BLM helicase gene resulted in defects in the DNA repair mechanism and was reported to be associated with Bloom syndrome (BS) and cancer. Despite extensive investigation of helicase proteins in humans, no attempt has previously been made to comprehensively analyse the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) of the BLM gene. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of SNPs on the BLM gene was performed to identify, characterize and validate the pathogenic SNPs using computational approaches. We obtained SNP data from the dbSNP database version 150 and mapped these data to the genomic coordinates of the "NM_000057.3" transcript expressing BLM helicase (P54132). There were 607 SNPs mapped to missense, 29 SNPs mapped to nonsense, and 19 SNPs mapped to 3'-UTR regions. Initially, we used many consensus tools of SIFT, PROVEAN, Condel, and PolyPhen-2, which together increased the accuracy of prediction and identified 18 highly pathogenic non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) out of 607 SNPs. Subsequently, these 18 high-confidence pathogenic nsSNPs were analysed for BLM protein stability, structure-function relationships and disease associations using various bioinformatics tools. These 18 mutants of the BLM protein along with the native protein were further investigated using molecular dynamics simulations to examine the structural consequences of the mutations, which might reveal their malfunction and contribution to disease. In addition, 28 SNPs were predicted as "stop gained" nonsense SNPs and one SNP was predicted as "start lost". Two SNPs in the 3'UTR were found to abolish miRNA binding and thus may enhance the expression of BLM. Interestingly, we found that BLM mRNA overexpression is associated with different types of cancers. Further investigation showed that the dysregulation of BLM is associated with poor overall survival (OS) for lung and gastric cancer patients and hence led to the conclusion that BLM has the potential to be used as an important prognostic marker for the detection of lung and gastric cancer.},

   abstract = {The latest coronavirus pandemic (SARS-CoV-2) poses an exceptional threat to human health and society worldwide. The coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein, which is required for viral-host cell penetration, might be considered a promising and suitable target for treatment. In this study, we utilized the nonalkaloid fraction of the medicinal plant Rhazya stricta to computationally investigate its antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were the main tools used to examine the binding interactions of the compounds isolated by HPLC analysis. Ceftazidime was utilized as a reference control, which showed high potency against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) in an in vitro study. The five compounds (CID:1, CID:2, CID:3, CID:4, and CID:5) exhibited remarkable binding affinities (CID:1, - 8.9; CID:2, - 8.7; and CID:3, 4, and 5, - 8.5 kcal/mol) compared to the control compound (- 6.2 kcal/mol). MD simulations over a period of 200 ns further corroborated that certain interactions occurred with the five compounds and the nonalkaloidal compounds retained their positions within the RBD active site. CID:2, CID:4, and CID:5 demonstrated high stability and less variance, while CID:1 and CID:3 were less stable than ceftazidime. The average number of hydrogen bonds formed per timeframe by CID:1, CID:2, CID:3, and CID:5 (0.914, 0.451, 1.566, and 1.755, respectively) were greater than that formed by ceftazidime (0.317). The total binding free energy calculations revealed that the five compounds interacted more strongly within RBD residues (CID:1 = - 68.8, CID:2 = - 71.6, CID:3 = - 74.9, CID:4 = - 75.4, CID:5 = - 60.9 kJ/mol) than ceftazidime (- 34.5 kJ/mol). The drug-like properties of the selected compounds were relatively similar to those of ceftazidime, and the toxicity predictions categorized these compounds into less toxic classes. Structural similarity and functional group analyses suggested that the presence of more H-acceptor atoms, electronegative atoms, acidic oxygen groups, and nitrogen atoms in amide or aromatic groups were common among the compounds with the lowest binding affinities. In conclusion, this in silico work predicts for the first time the potential of using five R. stricta nonalkaloid compounds as a treatment strategy to control SARS-CoV-2 viral entry.},

This highly pathogenic virus with high mortality rate is among one of the major public health concerns. Saudi Arabia remains to be the most affected region with the majority of MERS-CoV cases, and currently, no effective drugs and vaccines are available for prevention and treatment. A large amount of information is now available regarding the virus, its structure, route of transmission and its pathophysiology. Therefore, this review summarizes the current understanding of MERS-CoV's pathogenesis, treatment options and recent scientific advancements in vaccine and other therapeutic developments, and the major steps taken for MERS prevention control.},

   journal = {Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology},
   volume = {10},
   abstract = {Epithelial cancer cells that lose attachment from the extracellular matrix (ECM) to seed in a distant organ often undergo anoikis’s specialized form of apoptosis. Recently, KDM3A (H3K9 demethylase) has been identified as a critical effector of anoikis in cancer cells. However, whether other histone demethylases are involved in promoting or resisting anoikis remains elusive. We screened the major histone demethylases and found that both H3K27 histone demethylases, namely, KDM6A/B were highly expressed during ECM detachment. Inhibition of the KDM6A/B activity by using a specific inhibitor results in reduced sphere formation capacity and increased apoptosis. Knockout of KDM6B leads to the loss of stem cell properties in solitary cells. Furthermore, we found that KDM6B maintains stemness by transcriptionally regulating the expression of stemness genes SOX2, SOX9, and CD44 in detached cells. KDM6B occupies the promoter region of both SOX2 and CD44 to regulate their expression epigenetically. We also noticed an increased occupancy of the HIF1α promoter by KDM6B, suggesting its regulatory role in maintaining hypoxia in detached cancer cells. This observation was further strengthened as we found a significant positive association in the expression of both KDM6B and HIF1α in various cancer types. Overall, our results reveal a novel transcriptional program that regulates resistance against anoikis and maintains stemness-like properties.},

   abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is responsible for millions of deaths every year. The current treatment involves the use of multiple antiretroviral agents that may harm patients due to their toxic nature. RNA interference (RNAi) is a potent candidate for the future treatment of HIV, uses short interfering RNA (siRNA/shRNA) for silencing HIV genes. In this study, attempts have been made to create a database HIVsirDB of siRNAs responsible for silencing HIV genes.|HIVsirDB is a manually curated database of HIV inhibiting siRNAs that provides comprehensive information about each siRNA or shRNA. Information was collected and compiled from literature and public resources. This database contains around 750 siRNAs that includes 75 partially complementary siRNAs differing by one or more bases with the target sites and over 100 escape mutant sequences. HIVsirDB structure contains sixteen fields including siRNA sequence, HIV strain, targeted genome region, efficacy and conservation of target sequences. In order to facilitate user, many tools have been integrated in this database that includes; i) siRNAmap for mapping siRNAs on target sequence, ii) HIVsirblast for BLAST search against database, iii) siRNAalign for aligning siRNAs.|HIVsirDB is a freely accessible database of siRNAs which can silence or degrade HIV genes. It covers 26 types of HIV strains and 28 cell types. This database will be very useful for developing models for predicting efficacy of HIV inhibiting siRNAs.
