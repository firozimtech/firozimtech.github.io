# Research {#research}

Our lab conducts research in various areas, including:  



- __Exploring the Molecular Pathways of Abnormal Cell Proliferation in Lung Cancer__
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Our research is dedicated to unraveling the intricate mechanisms underlying non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and identifying the key regulators responsible for uncontrolled cell growth within this disease. NSCLC is characterized by the disruption of normal cell division, but the precise molecular processes driving this phenomenon are not yet fully understood. Through the use of advanced computational techniques and in-depth analysis of gene expression and protein interactions, our aim is to uncover the master regulators and specific network of genes that play a pivotal role in driving cell proliferation in NSCLC. These findings hold great potential as valuable biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the development of more effective treatments. Ultimately, our goal is to improve outcomes and enhance the quality of life for individuals affected by this challenging condition.
</p>

- __Advancing Predictive Models for Early Cancer Diagnosis and Prognosis__
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Our lab leverages the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced data analytics to create predictive models for early cancer diagnosis and prognosis. By utilizing AI algorithms and machine learning techniques, we analyze and integrate diverse datasets, including multi-omics and clinical data, to uncover hidden patterns and molecular signatures associated with different types of cancer. This enables us to identify biomarkers and genetic markers that play a crucial role in accurate cancer detection and prognosis. Through our research, we strive to harness the potential of AI to advance personalized medicine and improve patient outcomes in the fight against cancer.
</p>

- __Investigating the Underlying Mechanisms of Diabetes Pathogenesis__  
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Diabetes, a complex disease that impacts millions of people globally, remains a significant health concern. At our research lab, we are dedicated to unraveling the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the development and progression of diabetes. Our primary focus lies in investigating factors and gene regulatory networks that have the potential to safeguard pancreatic islets from damage during the advanced stages of this condition. Through our findings and ongoing research, we strive to make significant contributions to the development of more effective treatments and personalized approaches that can enhance the management of diabetes.
Our ultimate goal is to improve the lives of individuals affected by diabetes.
